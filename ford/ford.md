summary: A Fortran program performing thermodynamic calculations using cubic equations of state.

This program performs phase equilibrium calculations with cubic equations of state (Van der Waals, Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson).
It is currently under development and oriented to treat pure compounds. Mixtures will come later.
This program mainly exists to show how some modern fortran, with a slight object-oriented treatment, can be used in practice and also how to combine
a fortran program with Git (for backups), Gnuplot (for easy plotting) and Ford (for a clear documentation).

Because thermodynamics means a lot of equations, details are given in the README section of this documentation about the equations derivations.

Enjoy!
